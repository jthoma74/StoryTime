Jack needs to study, but his friends have peer-pressured him to go to a local biergarten in Mitte, Berlin. When he arrives, he quickly is overwhelmed by the beautiful live musik playing throughout the tavern. It's Rammstein, his favorite band -- not many would describe it as beautiful but he really, really, really likes it. He got hungry so he decided to buy a Bratwurst, it was really good. He drove his BMW home a happy man! As soon as he got home, he took off his Lederhose and went to bed.
