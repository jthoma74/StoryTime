Jack needs to study, but his friends have peer-pressured him to go to a local biergarten in Mitte, Berlin. 
When he arrives, he quickly is overwhelmed by the beautiful live musik playing throughout the tavern. 
It's Rammstein, his favorite band -- not many would describe it as beautiful but he really, really, really likes it. 
He got hungry so he decided to buy a Bratwurst, it was really good. 
He drove his BMW home a happy man! As soon as he got home, he took off his Lederhose and went to bed.
As he is drifting off to sleep, he has a very vivid Kopfkino that involves Schneewittchen and her 7 dwarves. In his dream, he was wearing a Dirndel and dancing around. Once he awoke, he realized he was going to be late for his flight if he didn't leave immediately so he headed straight to the flughafen.
